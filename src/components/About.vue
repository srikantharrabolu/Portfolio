    <h3>About</h3>
            <p>I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Koch Engineering Solutions, which is where my passion for VUE design and development converge. 
            See my previous work history on LinkedIn. Outside of work I have a beautiful wife.
            I am also working on a few side projects including Online store (Embroidery Designs for any occasions). 
            Currently I am not accepting freelance work, but I'd love to get coffee and get to know you, so donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch. </p>
            <h3>Services</h3>
            <h4>FRONT END DEVELOPMENT</h4>
            <p>Front End Development is building out the visual components of a website. Using HTML, CSS , and Javascript,
            I build fast, interactive websites. This also may include a CMS, API's or other integrations.
